Broken Symlink
-------------------

The problem with Uber's code after the DevOps team's change is that the
symbolic link latest-backup.obj now points to a file inside the backups directory.
This can cause issues because:
Broken Symbolic Link: If the script creating the daily backup runs after moving the symlink,
it will create a new latest-backup.obj inside the backups directory,
but the original symlink will still point to the previous location.
This will result in a broken symbolic link when trying to access the latest backup.
Here's how to fix the code:
mv backups/latest-backup.obj .  # Move the symlink back outside the backups directory
ln -s $(date +"%Y-%m-%d").obj latest-backup.obj  # Update the symlink to point to the new daily backup




Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 will be 7
 100 will be 4
 10110 will be 30
 2. 256
 3. Two's Complement. This method is efficient for calculations and is widely used in computers.
 The leftmost bit (MSB) of the 9 bits is designated as the sign bit. 0 represents positive numbers, and 1 represents negative numbers.
 4. 1 bit: Sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative)
 3 bits: Exponent (biased by 4 to represent both positive and negative powers of 2)
 4 bits: Mantissa (fractional part, representing digits after the decimal point)
